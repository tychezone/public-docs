1. NFT contracts have to implement a top level contractURI method as specc'd here [https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata) to ensure their NFT collections show up in our platform with the proper store front metadata
2. TokenURI has to follow this structure to ensure their NFTs show up with the right metadata [https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards)
